# Introduction to Ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. It allows you to manage multiple systems remotely with ease.

## Why Use Ansible?

- **Agentless:** No need to install any agent on client systems.
- **Simple YAML Syntax:** Uses human-readable YAML files for configuration.
- **Extensible:** Supports a wide range of modules for various tasks.

## Basic Concepts

- **Playbooks:** Define a series of tasks in a YAML file.
- **Inventory:** A list of managed nodes.
- **Modules:** Units of code that perform specific tasks.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Ansible:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ansible

2. Create an Inventory File:

[webservers]
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11

3. Write a Playbook:

---
- name: Ensure Apache is installed
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
4. Run the Playbook:

ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

Conclusion
Ansible streamlines the management of IT infrastructure, making it an essential tool for DevOps professionals.
